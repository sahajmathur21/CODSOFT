Hello,
This repository includes the source code of the tasks I have completed during by internship with Codsoft in C++ programming language.

The Task includes:
Task 1 : NUMBER GUESSING GAME
        In a number guessing game, the user guesses a randomly generated secret number within a given number of attempts.
After each guess, the user gets hints on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.The game ends when the user guesses the secret number or runs out of attempts.

Task 2 : SIMPLE CALCULATOR
         This is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.Also check the exceptions and errors .

Task 3 : TO-DO LIST
         Console-based to-do list manager that allows users to manage their tasks by adding, , deleting, marked as completed and viewing tasks. It uses ﬁle handling for data persistence, providing a simple and efﬁcient way to organize tasks.
